# Zig Snippets

This extension provides a comprehensive set of snippets for the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Snippets are separated into the following categories:

* Main language
* Templates

### Notes on v 2.0.0 +

Some snippets are been completly refactored to improve coding speed, others are been removed since ZLS provides an ergonomic and always updated version of them.
I hope you'll like it and ***Enjoy coding faster!*** with this.
